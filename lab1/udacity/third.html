        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>Block-level element: Paragraphs are block-level elements, meaning each new paragraph starts on a new line and occupies the full available width of its parent container by default.
Automatic spacing: Browsers automatically add some vertical white space (margins) before and after each paragraph, visually separating it from adjacent content.
Whitespace and line breaks: HTML browsers condense multiple spaces or line breaks within the source code into a single space when rendering the page. To preserve exact formatting (including spaces and line breaks), the <pre> tag is used instead. </p>
        <p>Readability: The use of paragraphs breaks down large blocks of text into digestible sections, significantly improving the readability and clarity of content for users.</p>

        <h1>Web Dev</h1>
        <p id="using-id">Web development involves creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications through coding,,, markup, and database management to ensure functionality and performance. It spans front-end (user-facing) and back-end (server-side) development, utilizing core languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to turn designs into interactive digital experiences. </p>
